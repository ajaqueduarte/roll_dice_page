# Rolling the Dice Game

## Introduction
"Rolling the Dice" is a web-based interactive game for two players, showcasing fundamental web development skills through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a demonstration of basic programming concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and the dynamic rendering of web content.

## Features
- **HTML:** Structures the webpage, providing the framework for the game's UI, including sections for each player, placeholders for dice images, and a roll button.
- **CSS:** (Though specifics were not accessed) Presumably styles the webpage to enhance visual appeal, using styling techniques to create an engaging user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactivity to the webpage, enabling players to roll dice with a click of a button. The script dynamically generates random dice outcomes, updates the webpage to display rolled values with corresponding images, and determines the game's outcome (win/lose/draw) based on the dice rolls.

## How to Set Up and Run
1. Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser to start the game.
3. Use the "Roll the Dice" button to play the game. Each player's roll is simulated with a click, and the game automatically displays the outcome.

## Dependencies
This project is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, requiring no external libraries or frameworks, making it easily runnable in any modern web browser.
